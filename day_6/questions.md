## Day 6 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
A class is a set of code that broadly describes an object, one could make a class
of "cars" and all individual cars would fall in this class
1. In relation to a Class, what is an attribute?
attribute describes the characteristics of the object in a class, for a car
that could be color, engine type, etc
1. In relation to a Class, what is behavior?
behavior is ways the class can change and interact, again with my car analogy
it would be drive, run out of gas, brake, etc
1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors
class Dog
attr_reader :age, :color, :excited
def initialize(age, color)
  @age = age
  @color = color
  @ecited = false
  end
def bark
p grows on trees
end

def walk
@excited = true
end
end

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
class.new  

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
I get the basics pretty well so i suppose i need to tinker with it more to see
what questions come up later
